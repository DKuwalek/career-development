# Repository for tracking milestones achieved on the personal and career path

Place where I note meaningful knowledge which I found in:
 - books
 - podcasts
 - online courses
 - online publications

## What is the reason for having this repository?

When I started reading books I discovered a need to have one list which reminds me which positions I have read and which books I want to read next.
I though of creating a document on my PC but I have more and more files piling up and the list of books would get lost deep in directories.
I created a Trello board with books but soon I wanted to create a place where I could store not only books, but also courses which I have attended, podcast episodes which I have litened to or any other meaningful piece of information which I learned from.
Creating a personal blog requires more time than creating a GitHub repo which is why this repo exists :).

I maintain my career progress on my linked-in profile but it has it's limits. GitHub repo has no limits.
